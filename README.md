# Mini Project 2: Spatial Influence on Dynamics of False Information Spread. 

## Description

Right now, just outputs a single random undirected graph using NetworkX at t = 0, 10, 25, 49
with proportions of believers, non-believers, and neutrals displayed over time. 
Next steps: dropdowns for changing seed which essentially changes network topology, inputs for #
of nodes, # of links, changing initial proportion values, changing rate, and implementing random walk
time??
