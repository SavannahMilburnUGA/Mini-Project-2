# Mini Project 2: Spatial Influence on Dynamics of False Information Spread. 

## Description

Right now, just outputs a single random undirected graph using NetworkX at 4 different time w/ proportions of believers, non-believers, and neutrals displayed over time. 
Next steps: 
- implementing random walker time
- dropdowns for changing seed which essentially changes network topology - seed is for reproducibility of random experiments
- changing initial proportion values
- changing rate
